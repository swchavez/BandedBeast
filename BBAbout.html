        <h3>
          it all began with the love of a dog.
        </h3>
        <p>
          After rescuing Holly while working at the County Seat Animal Hospital, we quickly became best friends. We were inseparable as she would follow me around and even came with me on my hunting trips. I have always enjoyed being out in nature and like my companion, Holly, I have always appreciated the highest of quality. That is why I began hand crafting my own hunting accessories with Bridle Leather because of its durable nature which allows the leather to remain of high quality for a long time. Quality and satisfaction is my main focus but my goal in handcrafting each item is to offer a unique and classy product that every hunter will be proud to show off

        <h3>
          Why I use Bridle Leather
        </h3>
        <p>
          There are many reasons for why I use Bridle Leather. From my own personal experience, I have found that there is no better leather for someone looking for great color and durability. Bridle leather has a flesh and grain side that through an intensive process is stuffed with greases and finished with wax. The process that bridle leather undergoes is only used on the highest quality of leathers because of the expensive nature of the leather. Bridle leather has a long history of being used in the equine industry due to the leatherâ€™s longevity and strength. The same techniques used to produce this leather has been used for hundreds of years and requires expert artisan craftsmanship to produce.
