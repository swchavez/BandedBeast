      <h3>It all began with the love of a dog.</h3>
      <p>After rescuing Holly while working at the County Seat Animal Hospital, we quickly became best friends. We were inseparable as she would follow me around and even came with me on my hunting trips.</p>
      <p>Holly and I have always appreciated the highest of quality. That is why I began hand crafting my own leather accessories with Bridle Leather because of its hundreds of years of artisan craftsmanship, its durable nature, and longitivtiy. Quality and satisfaction is my main focus but my goal in handcrafting each item is to offer a unique and classy product that will quickly become a favorite.</p>
